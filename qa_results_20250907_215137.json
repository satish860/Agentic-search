However, the agreement is notably silent on the notice period required to terminate renewals. While Section 4.2 provides for 30-day notice for termination for cause during the initial term, there is no corresponding provision addressing how either party can terminate the automatic annual renewals. This creates a significant legal ambiguity that could lead to disputes.\n\nANSWER: The contract does not specify any notice period to terminate renewals. While the agreement provides for automatic annual renewals for up to 10 additional years (Section 1.3), there is no provision establishing notice requirements for terminating these renewals.\n\nCITATIONS:\n1. \"If Distributor complies with all of the terms of this Agreement, the Agreement shall be renewable on an annual basis for one (1) year terms for up to another ten (10) years on the same terms and conditions as set forth herein.\" [Line: 30]\n\n2. \"Either party may terminate this Agreement upon 30 days prior written notice to the other upon the occurrence of any of the following events: (A) the Distributor's failure to make full and prompt payment to the Company of all sums due and owing to it; (b) either party's default in the performance of any of the material, terms, conditions, obligations, undertakings, covenants or liabilities set forth herein and such default is not cured within a commercially reasonable time after the defaulting party has been notified of the default by the other party and (c) as otherwise expressly provided herein.\" [Lines: 158-162]\n\n**LAWYER REVIEW RECOMMENDATION**: This is a critical gap that requires immediate attention.

These provisions create substantial exclusivity obligations that warrant legal review.\n\nANSWER: The following exclusivity-related provisions should be reviewed by a lawyer:\n\n**1.

While the Company has the right to suggest a range of manufacturer's suggested retail prices for the Products, the distributor is not obligated to set retail prices within the Company's suggested range of retail prices.\" [Lines: 104-105]\n\n3. **General Price Amendment Authority**: \"Company shall sell and deliver as provided in Section 2.3 of this Agreement to Distributor on the price terms set forth in this Agreement or as amended from time to time such quantity of Products as Distributor from time to time orders from Company.\" [Lines: 32-33]",

These types of licenses typically grant unrestricted usage rights without quantity limitations or minimum purchase requirements. The analysis reveals this is a traditional exclusive distributorship with specific quantity obligations, not an unlimited license arrangement.\n\nANSWER: No, there is no clause granting an \"enterprise,\" \"all you can eat,\" or unlimited usage license in this agreement. Instead, the contract contains the opposite - specific minimum purchase requirements and quantity limitations.\n\nCITATIONS:\n1. **Exclusive Distribution Rights with Quantity Limits**: \"Distributor must use all commercially reasonably efforts to purchase for sale to subdistributors the following minimum quantities of the Products from the Company\" [Lines: 36-37]\n\n2. **Specific Annual Minimums**: The contract sets precise minimum unit purchases ranging from 375 units in Year 1 to 2,856 units in later years [Lines: 44-58]\n\n3. **Financial Security Requirements**: \"Distributor will issue to the Company an irrevocable letter of credit ('LC') in the amount of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000)\" [Lines: 38-39]\n\n4. **Monthly Purchase Obligations**: \"A minimum of a $250,000.00 purchase order must be received by Company by the first of each month\" [Lines: 38-39]\n\n5. **Performance Evaluation**: \"If the Distributor shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the Distributor's exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market, may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated\" [Lines: 62-63]\n\nThe agreement establishes a traditional exclusive distributorship with defined territory (Illinois), specific performance metrics, and minimum purchase obligations - the antithesis of an unlimited usage license.",
