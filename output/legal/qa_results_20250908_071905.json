However, the document does not specify any notice period requirements for terminating these renewals. The termination provisions (Section 4.2) only address termination \"for cause\" during the active term, requiring 30 days notice for specific breach events, but there are no provisions addressing how either party can terminate the automatic annual renewals.\n\nANSWER: There is no notice period specified in this contract for terminating renewals. The agreement provides for automatic annual renewals for up to 10 additional years if the distributor complies with all terms, but does not include any provisions allowing either party to give notice to terminate these renewals.\n\nCITATIONS:\n1. \"If Distributor complies with all of the terms of this Agreement, the Agreement shall be renewable on an annual basis for one (1) year terms for up to another ten (10) years on the same terms and conditions as set forth herein.\" [Line: 30]\n2. \"All renewals of this Agreement shall be on the same terms and conditions as are set forth herein.\" [Line: 30]\n3.
