      "agent_response": "Based on my comprehensive analysis of the document, I need to search for specific provisions that would limit the Distributor's ability to transfer the license being granted to a third party. Let me examine the key sections more carefully.\n\nLEGAL ANALYSIS: The contract contains several provisions that create a non-transferable license framework. The most critical provision is in Section 1.2 which explicitly prohibits sublicensing of the Names license. Additionally, Section 6.1 contains assignment restrictions that effectively prevent transfer of the distributorship rights without Company consent. These provisions work together to create a non-transferable license structure.\n\nANSWER: Yes, the contract limits the ability to transfer the license through multiple provisions:\n\n1. **Section 1.2 - License Grant with Sublicensing Prohibition**: \"Distributor shall have no right to sublicense the Names or to do business under any other names without the Company's prior approval in writing.\"\n\n2. **Section 6.1 - Assignment Restrictions**: \"No assignment of this Agreement or any right accruing hereunder shall be made by the Distributor in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.\"\n\nCITATIONS:\n1. \"Distributor shall have no right to sublicense the Names or to do business under any other names without the Company's prior approval in writing.\" [Line: 24]\n2. \"No assignment of this Agreement or any right accruing hereunder shall be made by the Distributor in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the Company\" [Line: 232]",

The agreement establishes a minimum purchase obligation framework where the distributor must purchase specified quantities of products each year to maintain exclusivity.\n\n**ANSWER**: No provisions found for unlimited/all-you-can-eat licensing. The contract contains the opposite structure - it imposes minimum purchase requirements rather than granting unlimited usage rights.\n\n**CITATIONS**: The relevant provisions show quantity-based limitations:\n- \"Distributor must use all commercially reasonably efforts to purchase for sale to subdistributors the following minimum quantities of the Products from the Company\" [Lines 36-37]\n- Specific annual minimums: 375 units (1999), 750 units (2000), 937 units (2001), etc. [Lines 44-58]\n- \"A minimum of a $250,000.00 purchase order must be received by Company by the first of each month\" [Line 38]\n- \"If the Distributor shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the Distributor's exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market, may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated\" [Lines 62-63]\n\nThe agreement establishes a performance-based exclusivity model with specific quantity commitments, which is the antithesis of an unlimited usage license.",
