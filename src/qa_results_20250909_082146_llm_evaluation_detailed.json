      "agent_response": "Based on my comprehensive analysis of the document, I need to search for specific provisions that would limit the Distributor's ability to transfer the license being granted to a third party. Let me examine the key sections more carefully.\n\nLEGAL ANALYSIS: The contract contains several provisions that create a non-transferable license framework. The most critical provision is in Section 1.2 which explicitly prohibits sublicensing of the Names license. Additionally, Section 6.1 contains assignment restrictions that effectively prevent transfer of the distributorship rights without Company consent. These provisions work together to create a non-transferable license structure.\n\nANSWER: Yes, the contract limits the ability to transfer the license through multiple provisions:\n\n1. **Section 1.2 - License Grant with Sublicensing Prohibition**: \"Distributor shall have no right to sublicense the Names or to do business under any other names without the Company's prior approval in writing.\"\n\n2. **Section 6.1 - Assignment Restrictions**: \"No assignment of this Agreement or any right accruing hereunder shall be made by the Distributor in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.\"\n\nCITATIONS:\n1. \"Distributor shall have no right to sublicense the Names or to do business under any other names without the Company's prior approval in writing.\" [Line: 24]\n2. \"No assignment of this Agreement or any right accruing hereunder shall be made by the Distributor in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the Company\" [Line: 232]",
