The absence of a notice requirement for terminating renewals means either party could theoretically terminate renewal periods without advance notice, creating potential legal uncertainty.\n\nANSWER: No provisions found for notice period to terminate renewal.

This provision establishes both consent requirements and specific conditions that must be met for assignment approval, including the assignee's assumption of all obligations and demonstration of capability to perform.\n\n**ANSWER:** Yes, consent is required. The contract contains an anti-assignment provision that requires the Distributor to obtain the Company's prior written consent before assigning the agreement or any rights under it. The Company may not unreasonably withhold consent, but the assignee must agree in writing to assume all obligations and demonstrate economic and legal capability to perform.\n\n**CITATIONS:**\n1. \"No assignment of this Agreement or any right accruing hereunder shall be made by the Distributor in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.\" [Line: 232]\n2. \"As a condition to obtaining such consent, the Assignee of Distributor's interest hereunder shall first agree in writing in form and substance satisfactory to the Company, that is shall assume and be liable for the performance of all obligations imposes by this Agreement on Distributor\" [Line: 232]\n3. \"Company may assign its interest in this agreement to any person or entity which has authority to fulfill Company's obligations hereunder and which has the economic ability to perform its obligations hereunder.\" [Line: 232]",

The agreement contains no provisions requiring either party to share revenue or profits with the other party. The financial structure is based on fixed product pricing with CPI adjustments and minimum purchase requirements, not on revenue sharing arrangements.\n\n**ANSWER:** No provisions found requiring revenue or profit sharing between the parties.\n\n**CITATIONS:** After reviewing all sections of the agreement, including:\n- Section 2.4 (Prices) - establishes fixed pricing with CPI adjustments\n- Section 2.5 (Resale Prices) - allows distributor to set resale prices without revenue sharing\n- Section 1.6 (Minimum Expectations) - requires minimum purchases but no profit sharing\n- All other sections contain no revenue/profit sharing provisions\n\nThe agreement explicitly states in Section 1.7 that the relationship is \"vendor and vendee\" and \"does not create the relationship of principal and agent\" or \"partners, joint venturers,\" which confirms the absence of any profit-sharing arrangement.",

However, these adjustments are subject to important limitations.\n\n2. **Profit Margin Protection (Section 2.4(B))**: A critical restriction states that \"any increase in price based upon market demand shall not be so great as to deprive Distributor of its normal and customary profit margin.\" This creates a legal obligation for the Company to preserve the Distributor's profit margins when raising prices for market demand reasons.\n\n3. **Good Faith Requirement (Section 2.4(B))**: The Company must exercise its price adjustment rights \"in good faith, and consider all circumstances of the Distributor and the Company.\"\n\n4. **Resale Price Freedom (Section 2.5)**: The Distributor has complete discretion in setting resale prices, with only non-binding suggested retail price ranges from the Company.\n\nCITATIONS:\n1. \"The Company also reserves the right to increase or decrease the price per unit based on Company wide changes in unit prices to all distributors of the Company... provided further than any increase in price based upon market demand shall not be so great as to deprive Distributor of its normal and customary profit margin.\" [Lines: 102-103]\n\n2. \"The Company agrees to exercise this right in good faith, and consider all circumstances of the Distributor and the Company.\" [Line: 103]\n\n3. \"The Distributor may resell Products at such price, as the Distributor, in its sole discretion, shall determine.\" [Line: 104]",
