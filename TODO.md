# TODO List - Agentic Search Implementation

## Phase 1: Simple Prototype (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] **Create simple_agent.py with basic tools and agent loop** - DONE
- [x] **Implement ReadFile, WriteFile, and PowerShell tools** - DONE  
- [x] **Add XML tool call parsing** - DONE
- [x] **Create test script to verify basic functionality** - DONE
- [x] **Test with contract reading workflow** - DONE
- [x] **Add precise text extraction for QA matching** - DONE
- [x] **Test with sample QA dataset** - DONE
- [x] **Clean up and document solution** - DONE

### üéâ Success Results
- **Agent works perfectly** with 398 contract files
- **Tool calling** via XML parsing functions correctly
- **Agentic loop** completes multi-step tasks (think ‚Üí act ‚Üí observe ‚Üí repeat)
- **PowerShell integration** works for file listing
- **Contract analysis** successfully reads and summarizes complex contracts
- **File writing** creates summary files automatically
- **QA Text Extraction** finds ALL expected text spans (310 matches) for lawyer highlighting
- **Position accuracy** provides exact character positions for document highlighting
- **Multi-step reasoning** handles complex tasks across multiple iterations

### üìÅ Working Files
- `simple_agent.py` - Main agentic loop with tool calling
- `precise_extraction_agent.py` - Exact text extraction for QA
- `test_simple_agent.py` - Basic functionality tests
- `test_sample_qa.py` - QA comparison validation

## Phase 2: Enhanced Capabilities (Next Steps)

### Option A: Enhanced Tool Set (Recommended)
- [ ] Add GrepTool for pattern searching across multiple files
- [ ] Integrate existing ContractReader class for advanced contract parsing
- [ ] Add context/memory management for multi-document analysis
- [ ] Create CompareContractsTool for side-by-side analysis
- [ ] Add WebSearchTool for external legal research

### Option B: Multi-Agent System
- [ ] Create specialized agents (LegalAgent, FinancialAgent, TechnicalAgent)
- [ ] Implement agent coordination and task delegation
- [ ] Add shared context store for agent collaboration
- [ ] Build orchestrator for complex multi-agent workflows

### Option C: Production Features
- [ ] Add comprehensive error recovery and retry logic
- [ ] Implement structured logging and monitoring
- [ ] Create REST API endpoints for web integration
- [ ] Build simple web interface for contract upload/analysis
- [ ] Add authentication and user management

### Recommended Next Action
Start with **Option A: Enhanced Tool Set** to build on our solid foundation:
1. Add GrepTool first (search patterns across files)
2. Integrate ContractReader for better document parsing  
3. Test with more complex multi-document workflows
4. Then consider multi-agent capabilities

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (Future)
- [ ] Add context/memory management
- [ ] Test multi-step contract analysis tasks

## Phase 4: Extract Components (Future)
- [ ] Split into tools.py, agent.py, parser.py
- [ ] Create proper test suite
- [ ] Add logging and error handling
- [ ] Document API interfaces

## Phase 5: Production Architecture (Future)
- [ ] Full modular architecture
- [ ] Advanced tool registry
- [ ] Multi-agent orchestration
- [ ] Production deployment ready

## Current Focus: Single File Prototype

**Goal**: Create `simple_agent.py` that demonstrates:
1. Basic tool definition (ReadFile, WriteFile, BashCommand)
2. LLM integration for decision making
3. Simple agentic loop (think ‚Üí act ‚Üí observe ‚Üí repeat)
4. XML-based tool call parsing
5. Context management across iterations

**Success Criteria**: Agent can read a contract file and provide a summary by making tool calls to the LLM.
